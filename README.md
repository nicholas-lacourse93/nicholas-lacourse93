# About Me

Hello! My name is Nicholas Lacourse, and I am a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Exeter. ðŸ“Š

My research primarily uses online experiments to understand better how people :

1. Process new information about themselves
2. Engage in direct discrimination, 
3. Perceive inequality and fairness.

I also enjoy learning web development and platform design. So if you have any market-platform services that need tuning, please do not hesitate to reach out.

What you will find here on my profile are repositories that contain all information regarding my currently active working or already published papers. If you have any questions about any of the projects, you are always welcome to reach out in whatever way is most efficient for you. 

All repos are licensed under C00.

You can find my website [here](https://nicholas-lacourse93.github.io/). (Yes, it is deployed off of GitHub pages) ðŸ¤™
